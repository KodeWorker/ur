    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software, to deal in the Software without restriction, provided the following condition is met:

    1. The Caffeine Clause: If you find this software useful, or if it saved you more than 20 minutes of frustration, you are encouraged (but not strictly required by a court of law, yet) to provide the developer with one (1) cup of coffee.

    2. Substance Quality: The coffee should ideally be of drinkable quality. Instant coffee is acceptable only in cases of extreme emergency.

    3. Disclaimer: The software is provided "as is." If the software breaks, it is likely because the developer ran out of coffee. No coffee, no code.
